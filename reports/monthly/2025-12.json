Generate a synthetic classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 5 numerical features, and 2 categorical features (one with 3 unique values, one with 5 unique values). Introduce missing values (e.g., `np.nan`) into two of the numerical features.\n2. Create an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` to preprocess the data:\n    *   For numerical features: Impute missing values with the mean, then apply `StandardScaler`.\n    *   For categorical features: Apply `OneHotEncoder`.\n3. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies this `ColumnTransformer` and then trains a `RandomForestClassifier`.\n4. Evaluate the complete pipeline's performance using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) and report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation.",
  "2025-12-02": "1. Create an in-memory SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module.\n2. Create two tables: `customers` (columns: `customer_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `name` (TEXT), `city` (TEXT)) and `orders` (columns: `order_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `customer_id` (INTEGER), `amount` (REAL), `order_date` (TEXT)). Ensure `customer_id` in `orders` is a foreign key referencing `customers`.\n3. Insert sample data into both tables (at least 5 distinct customers and 10-15 orders, ensuring some customers have multiple orders).\n4. Using a single SQL query, calculate the total purchase `amount` for each customer, retrieving the customer's `name` and their `total_revenue`, joining the `customers` and `orders` tables.\n5. Retrieve these aggregated results directly into a pandas DataFrame and display the top 3 customers by their `total_revenue`.",
  "2025-12-03": "1. Generate a synthetic regression dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_regression` with at least 500 samples and 5 features.\n2. Create an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies `StandardScaler` to the features and then fits a `Ridge` regressor.\n3. Define a hyperparameter grid for the `Ridge` regressor within the pipeline, tuning the `alpha` parameter across at least 3 distinct values (e.g., `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0]`).\n4. Use `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` with the pipeline and the defined parameter grid to find the best hyperparameters. Use `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric and apply 3-fold cross-validation.\n5. Report the best hyperparameters found by `GridSearchCV` and the corresponding best score (remembering to convert the `neg_mean_squared_error` back to a positive MSE value)."

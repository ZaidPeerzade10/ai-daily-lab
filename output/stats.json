Generate a pandas DataFrame with 800 samples, including:\n    *   Three numerical features: `amount` (random positive floats, intentionally introduce some high outliers to simulate skewed transactions), `age` (random integers between 18-65), `duration_months` (random integers between 1-120).\n    *   One categorical feature: `region` (e.g., 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West' with varying proportions).\n    *   Ensure `amount` has a right-skewed distribution with some clear outliers (e.g., using `np.random.exponential` or adding a few large values).\n2. Calculate and display comprehensive descriptive statistics for the numerical features, grouped by the `region` categorical feature (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles).\n3. Create a set of subplots (e.g., 1 row, 2 columns) to visualize the distribution of `amount` and `duration_months` across different `region` categories. Use `seaborn.boxplot` or `seaborn.violinplot` for these visualizations. Ensure plots have appropriate titles and labels.\n4. Focus on the `amount` feature. Apply a `log1p` transformation (i.e., `np.log1p(feature)`) to this feature to mitigate its skewness and outliers. Create another set of side-by-side subplots showing:\n    *   A histogram or Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot of the *original* `amount` distribution.\n    *   A histogram or KDE plot of the *log1p-transformed* `amount` distribution.\n    Clearly label titles to highlight the effect of the transformation.\n5. Compute the pairwise correlation matrix for all numerical features in the DataFrame (using the *log1p-transformed* `amount` for the correlation calculation). Visualize this matrix using a `seaborn.heatmap` with annotations, ensuring a clear title.",

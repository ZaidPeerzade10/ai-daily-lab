  "task": "Given a pandas DataFrame containing at least four numerical features (`feature_A`, `feature_B`, `feature_C`, `feature_D`):\n1.  Create two new interaction features: `interaction_AB` (the product of `feature_A` and `feature_B`) and `interaction_CD` (the product of `feature_C` and `feature_D`).\n2.  Identify all numerical features (original and new) that have a skewness value greater than 0.75.\n3.  For each identified skewed feature, apply a `np.log1p` transformation, replacing the original feature column with its transformed version.\n4.  Display the head of the modified DataFrame and the skewness of all features after transformation.",
  "focus": "Feature Engineering (Interaction Features, Skewness Detection, Log Transformation)",
  "dataset": "A synthetic pandas DataFrame (e.g., 1000 rows) where `feature_A` is uniform, `feature_B` is normal, `feature_C` is exponential, and `feature_D` is Poisson. Ensure `feature_C` and `feature_D` will likely be skewed.",
  "hint": "Start by creating your synthetic DataFrame with `pd.DataFrame()` and `np.random` functions. Use `df.skew()` to quickly calculate skewness for all numerical columns. Remember `np.log1p(x)` handles zero values gracefully.",

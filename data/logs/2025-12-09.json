  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset (e.g., using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification`) with at least 1000 samples, 5 numerical features, and 1 conceptual 'high-cardinality' categorical feature. To create this categorical feature, generate a numerical feature with a large number of unique integer values (e.g., 50-100) and then convert it to string type.\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 split) using `train_test_split`.\n3. Create two distinct `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects for preprocessing and modeling:\n    *   `pipeline_onehot_encoding`: Use `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`. For the numerical features, apply `StandardScaler`. For the high-cardinality categorical feature, apply `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`.\n    *   `pipeline_ordinal_encoding`: Use `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`. For the numerical features, apply `StandardScaler`. For the high-cardinality categorical feature, apply `OrdinalEncoder(handle_unknown='use_encoded_value', unknown_value=-1)`.\n4. Both pipelines should then fit a `LogisticRegression` model (using `solver='liblinear'` and a `random_state` for reproducibility).\n5. Train both pipelines on the training data and evaluate their performance on the test set. Report the `accuracy_score` and `f1_score` for each pipeline, clearly stating which encoding strategy yielded which result.",

  "hint": "When creating the high-cardinality categorical feature, you can generate random integers within a broad range and then map them to unique string values (e.g., using a dictionary or f-strings). Ensure `ColumnTransformer` correctly identifies numerical and categorical features. Remember to explicitly set `handle_unknown` parameters for `OneHotEncoder` and `OrdinalEncoder` for robustness against unseen categories in the test set.",

  "task": "1. **Generate Synthetic Time Series Data**: Create a pandas DataFrame `df` with 700-900 daily entries. It should have a `date` column (daily dates starting from '2022-01-01') and a `sales` column. Populate `sales` with a synthetic time series exhibiting a clear linear trend, a strong monthly seasonality (e.g., using `np.sin` or `np.cos` with a 30-day period), and some random noise.\n2. **Feature Engineering for Forecasting**: Create the following new features in the DataFrame:\n    *   `day_of_week`: Integer representing the day of the week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday).\n    *   `month`: Integer representing the month.\n    *   `day_of_year`: Integer representing the day of the year.\n    *   `sales_lag_7`: The `sales` value from 7 days prior.\n3. **Prepare Data and Chronological Split**: Drop any rows that contain `NaN` values resulting from lag feature creation. Define features `X` (all engineered features) and target `y` (`sales`). Then, split the data into training and testing sets *chronologically*, using the last 90 days of data for the test set. Ensure `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test` are correctly defined.\n4. **Train and Evaluate a Regression Model**: Train an `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` (set `random_state=42`, `n_estimators=100`) on the training data. Predict `sales` for the test set. Calculate and report the `sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error` (MAE) and `sklearn.metrics.r2_score` of the model on the test set.\n5. **Visualize the Forecast**: Create a single line plot showing the actual `sales` values for the test period and the model's predicted `sales` values for the same period. Label the axes, add a title like 'Sales Forecast vs. Actuals', and include a legend to distinguish between actual and predicted lines.",

  "hint": "For the chronological split, you can simply slice your DataFrame using `iloc` based on the number of test samples needed from the end. Remember that `RandomForestRegressor` does not require explicit scaling for features like `StandardScaler` typically does for linear models.",

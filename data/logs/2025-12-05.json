  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` (e.g., 1000 samples, 10 features, 2 informative features, 2 classes).\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using `train_test_split`.\n3. Train a `LogisticRegression` model on the training data.\n4. Predict class labels and class probabilities for the positive class on the test set.\n5. Calculate and print the following evaluation metrics for the test set predictions: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.\n6. Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the model using `matplotlib.pyplot`, clearly labeling axes and adding a title. Include the AUC score in the plot legend.",

  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1500 samples, 8 features (e.g., `n_informative=6`), and 2 classes (set `random_state` for reproducibility).\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 split) using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.\n3. Create two distinct `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects for classification:\n    *   `pipeline_lr`: Consisting of `StandardScaler` followed by `LogisticRegression` (set `random_state=42`, `solver='liblinear'`).\n    *   `pipeline_gb`: Consisting of `StandardScaler` followed by `GradientBoostingClassifier` (set `random_state=42`).\n4. For each pipeline, define a small, focused hyperparameter grid for `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`:\n    *   For `pipeline_lr`: Tune `C` (e.g., `[0.1, 1, 10]`).\n    *   For `pipeline_gb`: Tune `n_estimators` (e.g., `[50, 100]`) and `learning_rate` (e.g., `[0.05, 0.1]`).\n5. Perform `GridSearchCV` *separately* for `pipeline_lr` and `pipeline_gb` on the training data. Use 3-fold cross-validation and `scoring='roc_auc'` for both. (Set `n_jobs=-1` for faster execution).\n6. Report the `best_params_` and `best_score_` (ROC AUC) for each model (Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Classifier).\n7. Using the *best estimators* obtained from `GridSearchCV` for both models, predict probabilities for the positive class (class 1) on the test set.\n8. Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for *both* models on the *same* plot using `sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator` (or `from_predictions` if preferred). Ensure the plot has a clear title, a legend indicating which curve belongs to which model, and displays the AUC score for each model.",

  "hint": "Remember to use the `best_estimator_` attribute from your trained `GridSearchCV` objects to make predictions and plot ROC curves on the test set. Keep the hyperparameter grids small to ensure the task finishes within the time limit. `n_jobs=-1` for GridSearchCV can speed up cross-validation.",

  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic transactional dataset using `pandas`:\n    *   Create a DataFrame named `transactions_df` with 800-1000 rows.\n    *   Columns should include:\n        *   `transaction_id` (unique integer IDs).\n        *   `customer_id` (e.g., 50-100 distinct customer IDs).\n        *   `transaction_date` (daily dates spanning 1-2 years, starting from '2022-01-01', ensuring multiple transactions per day/customer).\n        *   `amount` (random float values, e.g., between 10.0 and 500.0).\n        *   `product_category` (3-5 distinct string categories, e.g., 'Electronics', 'Books', 'Groceries', 'Clothing').\n    *   Sort the DataFrame by `customer_id` and then `transaction_date`.\n2. Create an in-memory SQLite database using `sqlite3` and load the `transactions_df` into a table named `transactions`.\n3. **SQL Analytics (Window Function 1 - Running Total)**: Write an SQL query to calculate the `running_total_amount` for each customer, ordered by their `transaction_date`. The query should return `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `transaction_date`, `amount`, and the new `running_total_amount` column. Retrieve the results into a pandas DataFrame and display its head.\n4. **SQL Analytics (Window Function 2 - Rank within Group)**: Write a *separate* SQL query to rank transactions by `amount` in descending order *within each `product_category`*. The query should return `transaction_id`, `product_category`, `amount`, and the new `rank_in_category` column. Retrieve these results into another pandas DataFrame and display its head.\n5. Briefly describe what each window function achieves and how it's useful in analytical contexts.",

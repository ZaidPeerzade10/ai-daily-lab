  "task": "1. Create an in-memory SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module.\n2. Create two tables: `customers` (columns: `customer_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `name` (TEXT), `city` (TEXT)) and `orders` (columns: `order_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `customer_id` (INTEGER), `amount` (REAL), `order_date` (TEXT)). Ensure `customer_id` in `orders` is a foreign key referencing `customers`.\n3. Insert sample data into both tables (at least 5 distinct customers and 10-15 orders, ensuring some customers have multiple orders).\n4. Using a single SQL query, calculate the total purchase `amount` for each customer, retrieving the customer's `name` and their `total_revenue`, joining the `customers` and `orders` tables.\n5. Retrieve these aggregated results directly into a pandas DataFrame and display the top 3 customers by their `total_revenue`.",

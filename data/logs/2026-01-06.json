  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 6 informative features, and 2 classes (set `random_state` for reproducibility). Convert the features (`X`) and target (`y`) into a pandas DataFrame.\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 split) using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.\n3. Create two distinct `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects for classification:\n    *   `pipeline_baseline`: Consisting of `StandardScaler` followed by `LogisticRegression` (set `random_state=42`, `solver='liblinear'` for reproducibility).\n    *   `pipeline_polynomial`: Consisting of `StandardScaler`, then `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)`, followed by `LogisticRegression` (set `random_state=42`, `solver='liblinear'` for reproducibility).\n4. Evaluate both pipelines using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) on the training data. Use `scoring='roc_auc'` for performance comparison.\n5. Report the mean and standard deviation of the ROC AUC scores for both the `pipeline_baseline` and `pipeline_polynomial`. Based on these results, briefly discuss the impact of including polynomial features on model performance for this dataset.",

  "dataset": "`sklearn.datasets.make_classification` for a synthetic classification problem.",
  "hint": "Remember that `PolynomialFeatures` can significantly increase the number of features. `include_bias=False` prevents adding a column of all ones, which is usually handled by the `LogisticRegression` intercept. Focus on comparing the ROC AUC scores for a robust evaluation of classification performance.",

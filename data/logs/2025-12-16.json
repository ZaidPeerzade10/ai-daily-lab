  "task": "1. Generate a pandas DataFrame with a `date` column (daily data for 2-3 years, starting from a fixed date like '2020-01-01'), a `value` column (synthetic time-series data with a linear trend, seasonality using `np.sin`, and some noise), and two additional numerical features (`feature_A`, `feature_B`) which can be random.\n2. Using `pandas` operations, create the following new features:\n    *   `lag_1_value`: The `value` from the previous day.\n    *   `rolling_7d_mean_feature_A`: A 7-day rolling mean of `feature_A`.\n    *   `day_of_week_num`: Numerical day of the week (0-6).\n    *   `month_num`: Numerical month (1-12).\n3. Handle any `NaN` values introduced by lag/rolling features (e.g., by dropping the first few rows).\n4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets based on time (e.g., use the first 80% of data for training and the remaining 20% for testing).\n5. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies `StandardScaler` to all numerical features (including the newly engineered ones) and then trains a `Ridge` regressor.\n6. Train the pipeline on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test set, reporting the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score.",

  "dataset": "Synthetic time-series regression data with a `date` column and multiple features.",
  "hint": "Ensure your DataFrame is sorted by `date` before creating lag and rolling features. When splitting the data based on time, remember to select features and target correctly after handling NaNs. For the pipeline, identify all numerical features (original + engineered) that need scaling. Evaluate using `mean_absolute_error` and `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.",

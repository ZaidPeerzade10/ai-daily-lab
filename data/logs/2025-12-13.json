  "task": "1. Create an in-memory SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module.\n2. Create a `transactions` table with the following columns: `transaction_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `customer_id` (INTEGER), `product_id` (INTEGER), `transaction_date` (TEXT in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format), and `amount` (REAL).\n3. Insert synthetic data into the `transactions` table. Include at least 5 distinct customers, 3 distinct products, and 20-30 transactions spanning a few months.\n4. Write a single SQL query that uses **window functions** to calculate the following for each transaction:\n    *   `customer_monthly_total`: The sum of `amount` for that specific `customer_id` within the month of the `transaction_date`.\n    *   `customer_monthly_avg_transaction`: The average `amount` for that specific `customer_id` within the month of the `transaction_date`.\n    *   `customer_cumulative_total`: The running total of `amount` for that specific `customer_id`, ordered by `transaction_date`.\n5. Retrieve the results of this SQL query into a pandas DataFrame. Display `transaction_date`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `customer_monthly_total`, `customer_monthly_avg_transaction`, and `customer_cumulative_total`. Show the head of the DataFrame.",

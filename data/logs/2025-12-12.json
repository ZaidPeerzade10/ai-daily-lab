  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 4 numerical features, and 2 classes. Convert the features and target into a pandas DataFrame.\n2. Select two of the original numerical features (e.g., `feature_0`, `feature_1`) and apply `pd.cut` to each of them to discretize them into 3-4 bins (e.g., `['low', 'medium', 'high']`). These new binned features should be categorical and added to the DataFrame.\n3. Create an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` to preprocess the data:\n    *   For the *remaining original* numerical features (those not binned): Apply `StandardScaler`.\n    *   For the *newly binned* categorical features: Apply `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`.\n4. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies this `ColumnTransformer` and then trains a `GradientBoostingClassifier` (set `random_state` for reproducibility).\n5. Evaluate the complete pipeline's performance using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) with `accuracy` as the scoring metric. Report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation.",

  "hint": "When setting up the `ColumnTransformer`, ensure you correctly identify which features go to `StandardScaler` (original numerical features that were *not* binned) and which go to `OneHotEncoder` (the *new* binned categorical features). Use `make_column_transformer` for easier column selection.",

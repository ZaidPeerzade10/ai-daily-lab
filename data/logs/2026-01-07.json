  "task": "1. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Create two pandas DataFrames:\n    *   `customers_df`: With 100-150 rows. Columns: `customer_id` (unique integers), `customer_name` (e.g., 'Customer A'), `registration_date` (random dates over the last 3 years).\n    *   `orders_df`: With 800-1000 rows. Columns: `order_id` (unique integers), `customer_id` (randomly sampled from `customers_df` IDs, ensuring some customers have no orders and others have many), `order_date` (random dates after their `registration_date`), `amount` (random floats between 10 and 1000).\n2. **Load into SQLite**: Create an in-memory SQLite database using `sqlite3` and load both `customers_df` and `orders_df` into tables named `customers` and `orders` respectively.\n3. **SQL Query - Customer Sales Aggregation and Segmentation**: Write a single SQL query that performs the following:\n    *   **Joins** the `customers` and `orders` tables.\n    *   **Aggregates** to calculate the `total_sales_amount` and `number_of_orders` for each customer. Ensure that customers with no orders are still included in the result, showing 0 for sales and orders.\n    *   **Categorizes** each customer into a `customer_segment` based on their `total_sales_amount`:\n        *   'High-Value' if `total_sales_amount` > 5000\n        *   'Medium-Value' if `total_sales_amount` between 1000 and 5000 (inclusive)\n        *   'Low-Value' if `total_sales_amount` between 1 and 999 (inclusive)\n        *   'No-Orders' if `total_sales_amount` is 0 or NULL.\n    *   The query should return `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `registration_date`, `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_orders`, and `customer_segment`.\n4. **Retrieve and Display**: Fetch the results into a pandas DataFrame. Display its head and then print the count of customers within each `customer_segment` to verify your segmentation logic.",

  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic regression dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_regression` with 1000 samples, 6 informative features, and a small amount of noise. Convert the features (`X`) into a pandas DataFrame, assigning generic column names (e.g., `feature_0`, `feature_1`, ..., `feature_5`).\n2. **Feature Engineering**: Create a new interaction feature named `feature_0_x_feature_1` by multiplying `feature_0` and `feature_1`. Add this new feature to a *copy* of your DataFrame to create `X_with_interaction`. Keep the original DataFrame as `X_original`.\n3. Create two `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects, both consisting of `StandardScaler` followed by `LinearRegression`.\n    *   `pipeline_no_interaction`\n    *   `pipeline_with_interaction`\n4. Evaluate both pipelines using `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` with 5-fold cross-validation and `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric:\n    *   Evaluate `pipeline_no_interaction` using `X_original` and the target `y`.\n    *   Evaluate `pipeline_with_interaction` using `X_with_interaction` and the target `y`.\n    Print the mean and standard deviation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both, clearly labeling results.\n5. **Feature Importance Visualization**: Train `pipeline_with_interaction` on the *entire* `X_with_interaction` and `y` dataset. Extract the coefficients from the `LinearRegression` model within this trained pipeline. Create a bar plot using `matplotlib.pyplot` or `seaborn` showing the *absolute magnitude* of these coefficients. Map these to their corresponding feature names from `X_with_interaction`. Title the plot appropriately, e.g., 'Linear Regression Coefficients (Absolute Magnitude)'.",

  "hint": "When setting up the pipelines, the `StandardScaler` and `LinearRegression` steps can be named for easier access (e.g., `('scaler', StandardScaler())`, `('regressor', LinearRegression())`). To access coefficients from a trained pipeline, use `pipeline_with_interaction.named_steps['regressor'].coef_`. Ensure your feature names for the plot match the columns of `X_with_interaction`.",

  "task": "1. Generate a synthetic regression dataset: Create a pandas DataFrame `X` with 1000 samples and 3 numerical features (e.g., `feature_A`, `feature_B`, `feature_C`) using `np.random.rand()` for values between 0 and 1. Generate a target variable `y` such that `y = 2 * X['feature_A'] + 3 * (X['feature_B']**2) - X['feature_C'] + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, size=1000)`. \n2. Visualize feature-target relationships: Use `seaborn.jointplot` or `seaborn.pairplot` to explore the relationships between each feature in `X` and the target `y`. Pay close attention to any non-linear patterns that might be present.\n3. Engineer a new feature: Based on your visual inspection from step 2, identify the feature that appears to have a non-linear relationship with `y` and create a new feature by squaring that specific feature (e.g., if `feature_B` shows a quadratic relationship, create `feature_B_squared`). Add this new feature to a copy of your DataFrame, named `X_engineered`.\n4. Build and compare pipelines: Create two `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects:\n    *   `pipeline_original`: Apply `StandardScaler` to the original DataFrame `X` and then fit a `LinearRegression` model.\n    *   `pipeline_engineered`: Apply `StandardScaler` to the `X_engineered` DataFrame (which includes original features plus the new squared feature) and then fit a `LinearRegression` model.\n5. Evaluate performance: Use `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` with 5-fold cross-validation and `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric for both pipelines. Print the mean and standard deviation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each, clearly indicating the performance difference achieved by the engineered feature (remember to convert `neg_mean_squared_error` to positive MSE values).",

  "hint": "When using `seaborn.jointplot`, try different `kind` parameters (e.g., 'reg', 'kde', 'hex') to better visualize the relationship between individual features and the target. The goal is to visually identify which original feature, when transformed (squared in this case), might improve the model's performance by better capturing the underlying data generation process.",

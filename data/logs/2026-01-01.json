  "task": "1. **Generate Synthetic Time Series Data**: Create a pandas DataFrame `df` with 800 daily entries. It should have a `date` column (daily dates starting from '2023-01-01') and a `sales_amount` column. Populate `sales_amount` with a synthetic time series, for example, a combination of a linear trend, a yearly seasonality (using `np.sin`), and some random noise (using `np.random.normal`).\n2. **Feature Engineering - Lag Features**: Create two new features in the DataFrame: `sales_amount_lag_1` (representing the sales from the previous day) and `sales_amount_lag_7` (representing sales from 7 days prior) using pandas' `shift()` method.\n3. **Feature Engineering - Rolling Statistics**: Create two more new features: `rolling_mean_3_days` (a 3-day rolling mean of `sales_amount`) and `rolling_std_7_days` (a 7-day rolling standard deviation of `sales_amount`) using pandas' `rolling()` method. Ensure you handle potential `NaN` values from rolling operations (e.g., `min_periods=1` if you want to keep early rows, or simply let `NaN`s propagate and drop later).\n4. **Handle Missing Values and Prepare for Modeling**: After creating all engineered features, drop any rows that contain `NaN` values (which will typically appear at the beginning of the DataFrame due to `shift` and `rolling` operations). Then, define the target variable `y` as the `sales_amount` column of the processed DataFrame, and the features `X` as all the engineered lag and rolling features. Display the head of the final `X` and `y` DataFrames to show the prepared dataset.\n5. **Visualize Feature-Target Relationship**: Pick one of the engineered features (e.g., `sales_amount_lag_1`) and plot its relationship with the `sales_amount` target using a `seaborn.lineplot` or `seaborn.scatterplot`. Ensure the plot has appropriate labels and a title.",
